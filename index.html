        <h1>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</h1>
        <h2>By Lewis Carroll</h2>

        <div class="text">
            <p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,
            and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse
            was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were
            using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over 
            its head. 'Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice; 'only,
            as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p>

            <p>The Table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
            one corner of it: 'No room! No room!' they cried out when they saw
            Alice coming. 'There's plenty of room!' said Alice indignantly,
            and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p>
